# FinalProjectScript
Bash Script for Final Project.
Created my Online git hub repo, then I
downloaded git to my linux system as well as nano text editor. Next, I
cloned my code from github to my local machine. I then 
Created my script. Next, I
Ran "ls -al" to see my created script.
Once created, i ran "chmod +x finalprojectscript.sh" to make my file executable. I
Did "git add *" to add everything to the commit.
Did "git commit" to commit my changes and 
finally i ran "git push" to push everything to my github repo.
